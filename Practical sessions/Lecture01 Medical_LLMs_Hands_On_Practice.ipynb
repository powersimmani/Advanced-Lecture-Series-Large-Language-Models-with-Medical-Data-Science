    "\n",
    "1. **Environment Setup**: Installing and configuring medical NLP libraries\n",
    "2. **Pre-trained Models**: Loading and using medical language models (BioGPT, ClinicalBERT)\n",
    "3. **Clinical NER**: Extracting medical entities from clinical text\n",
    "4. **Medical QA**: Building question-answering systems for healthcare\n",
    "5. **Text Classification**: Categorizing clinical notes by urgency\n",
    "6. **Medical Chatbot**: Creating interactive medical information systems\n",
    "7. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing performance on medical benchmarks\n",
    "8. **HIPAA Compliance**: Anonymizing PHI for data privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights:\n",
    "- Medical AI requires specialized models trained on clinical data\n",
    "- HIPAA compliance is critical - always anonymize PHI\n",
    "- Current medical LLMs achieve 85-90% accuracy on benchmark tests\n",
    "- Evaluation should include clinical validation, not just technical metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Fine-tune models on your specific medical domain\n",
    "- Implement comprehensive PHI detection using Presidio\n",
    "- Deploy models with proper security and audit logging\n",
    "- Conduct clinical validation studies\n",
