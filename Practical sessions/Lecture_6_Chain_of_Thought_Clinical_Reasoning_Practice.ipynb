    "## 🎯 Practice Complete!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of What We Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Zero-Shot CoT**: Adding \"Let's think step by step\" dramatically improves reasoning\n",
    "2. **Few-Shot CoT**: Providing examples teaches the model your preferred reasoning format\n",
    "3. **Self-Consistency**: Multiple reasoning paths + voting increases confidence\n",
    "4. **Clinical Applications**: CoT works for diagnosis, treatment, drug interactions, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Performance Improvements:\n",
    "- 📈 **15-80% accuracy increase** on complex medical reasoning tasks\n",
    "- 🔍 **More transparent reasoning** - you can audit the logic\n",
    "- ⚕️ **Safer clinical decisions** - systematic approach reduces errors\n",
    "- 📝 **Better documentation** - reasoning is explicit and traceable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trade-offs:\n",
    "- ⏱️ **2-3x slower** - more tokens generated\n",
    "- 💰 **Higher API costs** - longer completions\n",
    "- ✅ **But much more accurate and trustworthy!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices Recap:\n",
    "1. ✅ Use clear, explicit step labels\n",
    "2. ✅ Reference clinical guidelines when possible\n",
    "3. ✅ Always verify reasoning logic\n",
    "4. ✅ Include safety checks\n",
    "5. ✅ Test on diverse cases\n",
    "6. ❌ Don't use vague instructions\n",
    "7. ❌ Don't skip validation steps\n",
    "8. ❌ Never blindly trust outputs - human review is essential!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Try these techniques on your own clinical cases\n",
    "- Experiment with different prompt formulations\n",
    "- Build custom few-shot example libraries for your specialty\n",
    "- Integrate CoT into clinical decision support tools\n",
    "- Always validate with domain experts!\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Critical Reminder:\n",
    "**Chain-of-Thought prompting is a powerful tool to augment, not replace, clinical judgment. Always have outputs reviewed by qualified healthcare professionals.**"
